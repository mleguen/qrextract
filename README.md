# qrextract

Extract QR codes from images for further processing.

It is designed to be used as a preprocessor, for zbarimg for example, which is unable to scan efficiently small QR codes from full page documents.

## Usage

```js
const fs = require("fs")
const jpeg = require("jpeg-js")
const qrextract = require("qrextract")

var inputImg = jpeg.decode(fs.readFileSync("input.jpeg"))

qrextract.everyCodeImage(inputImg, function(outputImg, index) {
	var filename = 'code_000'.slice(0,-index.toString().length)+index+'.jpg'
	fs.writeFile(filename, jpeg.encode(outputImg, 100).data)
	return true
})
```
## API

### General behavior

`qrextract` functions work as `Array.prototype.every()`:
- they call `callback` once for every thing it is required to look for
- they stop as soon as one of `callback` calls returns `false`
- they return `true` if all `callback` calls return `true`, `false` otherwise.

The same image format as `jpeg-js` module is used.

The behavior of these functions can be customized by passing a `customOptions` object as the last parameter, with the following properties (default values are used for missing properties):
- `angleCompatMarginPct`: error margin in % when checking that the 3 marks of a QR code form a 90Â° angle (default value: `0.05` for 5%)
- `blackWhiteMinDiff`: minimum color value difference between black and white modules ("dots") of a QR code (default value: `100`)
- `codeVersionMin` and `codeVersionMax`: minimum and maximum QR code versions to look for (default values: `1` and `40`, ie all possible versions)
- `moduleCompatMarginPct`: error margin in % for the module size of 2 marks to be compatible enough to belong to the same QR code (default value: `0.05` for 5%)
- `moduleSizePxMin`: minimum QR code module size to look for (default value: `5`)
- `moduleXYCompatMarginPct`: error margin in % for the X and Y module size of a possible mark to be compatible enough for it to be considered as a QR code mark (default value: `0.2` for 20%)
- `windowSizePx`: size of the small pixel window used when looking for marks on the X axis (default value: `100`). This window is used to determine the threshold between white and black modules in a QR code, as this threshold can vary in the image
- `zoneLengthMarginPx`: error margin in pixels for the black and white zones of a possible mark to be considered as having coherent enough lengths for them to belong to a QR code mark (default value: `2`)
- `skipRowsPx`: to speed the process up, as a single QR code mark is usualy several rows high, only 1 over `skipRowsPx` rows is scanned for marks (default value: `moduleSizePxMin`)

### qrextract.everyCodeImage(image, callback, customOptions = {})

Call `callback` for every QR code found in `image`, with the QR code image and its index.

### qrextract.everyMarkImage(image, callback, customOptions = {})

Call `callback` for every possible QR code marks found in `image`, with the mark image and its index.

This function corresponds to the step 1 of 4 of the algorithm used by `qrextract.everyCodeImage()` above.

Warning: not all of these possible marks are guaranteed to be QR code marks!

### qrextract.everyPairImage(image, callback, customOptions = {})

Call `callback` for every compatible pairs of QR code marks found in `image`, with the pair image and its index.

This function corresponds to the steps 1 and 2 of 4 of the algorithm used by `qrextract.everyCodeImage()` above.

Warning: not all of these pairs are guaranteed to be pairs of marks belonging to the same QR codes!

### qrextract.everyTripleImages(image, callback, customOptions = {})

Call `callback` for every compatible triples of QR code marks found in `image`, with the triple image and its index.

This function corresponds to the steps 1 to 3 of 4 of the algorithm used by `qrextract.everyCodeImage()` above.

Warning: all of these triples are guaranteed to be triples of marks belonging to the same QR codes!

### qrextract.every[...]BoudingBox(image, callback, customOptions = {})

Same thing as `qrextract.every[...]Image()` functions described above, but `callback` is called with a bounding box instead of an image.

The bounding box is an object with:
- 2 `x` and `y` properties, each one an object with `min` and `max` properties, describing the min and max coordinates of the box on the X and Y axis
- a `threshold` property with the threshold value used to distinguish white and black pixels
